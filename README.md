This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

About the project
Quarantine has started making me feel a bit bored, so I thought it was time to learn react. This project is part of my learn js/reactjs through developing mini apps. 

Aside from ReactJS, this also connects to a firebase cloud firestore database.
